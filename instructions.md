 ![Sorted Bars](photos/Frame Build Photos/2.jpg) ![connectors](photos/Frame Build Photos/3.jpg)
 
 1. Check that your kit has all the proper frame bars & connectors. See **BOM-Master's STR-BAR-PCK-0001** tab for a list of bars. See **BOM-Master's "Kit Stage 1 BOM"** to find the connectors- STR-CON-0001, STR-CON-0002, STR-CON-0003.
 2.  Set the baseplate to the side for now, and group the bars by length
 
#### Base Layer
  
1. Collect the Base Layer Components:
  * x2 of STR-BAR-0001
  * x1 of STR-BAR-0003
  * x1 of STR-BAR-0004

  * x3 of STR-CON-0002
  * x2 of STR-CON-0003

2. In x1 **STR-BAR-0001** bar, Insert x2 of **STR-CON-0001**. In The other **STR-BAR-0001**, insert x1 **STR-CON-0001** and x1 **STR-CON-0002**. Wider hole spacing should be through the vertical surface, as shown. These bars run along the bottom side of the grow chamber.

![STR-BAR-0001 with STR-CON components.](photos/Frame Build Photos/Bottom Layer1 .jpg)

3. Lay down one **STR-BAR-0003** in back, and one **STR-BAR-0008** in front. The wider hole spacing on **STR-BAR-0003** should be on the vertical surface. Make sure the 4-way connnector STR-CON-0002 is in the far left corner. Some *light* force may be required here. Set This Assembly to the side

![Grow Chamber portion of bottom layer.](Frame Build Photos/Bottom Layer Half 1.jpg)
 
4. Gather x1 of: **STR-BAR-0004**, **STR-BAR-0005**, **STR-BAR-0006**, **STR-BAR-0007**.
5. Connect x1 of **STR-CON-0001**  and x1 of **STR-CON-0002** into **STR-BAR-0005**, in orientation shown below. 
6. Connect **STR-BAR-0004** onto the 3-way connector, wider hole spacing vertical on the vertical surface, **STR-BAR-0007** perpendicular on the 4-way connector, and **STR-BAR-0006** parallel, with holes oriented as shown. 

![Electric Box Portion of Bottom Layer.](photos/Frame Build Photos/Bottom Layer 3.jpg)

7. Insert x1 **STR-CON-0003** into the end of **STR-BAR-0007** & **STR-BAR-0006**. 
8. Double check all bar orientations, then attach the two assemblies together. 

#### Top Layer

1. In x1 **STR-BAR-0001** bar, Insert x2 of **STR-CON-0001**. In The other **STR-BAR-0001**, insert x2 **STR-CON-0002** and x1 **STR-CON-0002**. Wider hole spacing should be through the vertical surface, as shown. These bars run along the top side of the grow chamber.

![Top Side Bars of Growing Chamber](photos/Frame Build Photos/Top Layer 1.jpg)

2. Lay down one **STR-BAR-0003** in back, and one **STR-BAR-0008** in front. Again, the wider hole spacing on **STR-BAR-0003** should be Through the verical surface. Some *light* force may be necessary here.

![Growing Chamber Half of Top Layer](photos/Frame Build Photos/Top Layer 13.jpg)

9. check orientations, attach halves.

### Mounting Vertical Members
1. There are three vertical members: **STR-BAR-0002**, **STR-BAR-0009** & **STR-BAR-0010**
 * Refering to **BOM-Master's STR-BAR-PCK-0001**, 
  * **STR-BAR-0010** has L-brackets attached to it, with two larger holes on the bottom. 
  * **STR-BAR-0009** has 10 holes, including Threads for the door attachement
  * **STR-BAR-0002** has 16 holes, and stands in the Rear of the growing chamber. 
2. Attach all **STR-BAR-0010** to the Electronics Box side- the smaller bottom half. 
3. Attach both **STR-BAR-0002** to the back two connectors of the growing chamber, wider hole spacing towar back. 
4. attach both **STR-BAR-0009** to the front two connectors, threaded holes facing outward.

 46. Bundle the ratsnest on the back side into an orderly wire route by starting at the edges of the bundle and then moving inward. For example, bundle the all the red wires near the 12V bus that are close to each other. Do this for all the power bus bars. Then, move to the connectors on the other side of the wires and make sure the red and black wires coming into the them are of even lengths. Slowly tie the wires into the "main veins" and adjust as needed to make the routing look clean. It may be helpful to use place holder zip-ties in the process to help organize the clutter. Make sure the wires end up routed as they are in the photo below: ![brain_panel_post_routing_front] (photos/brain_panel_post_routing_front.JPG) ![brain_panel_post_routing_back] (photos/brain_panel_post_routing_back.JPG)
